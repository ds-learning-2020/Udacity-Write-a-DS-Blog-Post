## Project Files

- **README**: Contains a brief overview of what this project is about.
- **seattle_airbnb.ipynb**: The jupyter notebook containing all the necessary code used to clean, prepare, and analyze the data, and then to answer the relevant business questions using that data.

## Project Motivation

This project is part of Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree program. We are required to utilize a specific dataset, clean and analyze it to answer some business questions related to the dataset. I chose the Seattle Airbnb Dataset for this project.

## Project Results
Following are the results of the three business questions I posed - 

1. Months of July (152.09 dollars), and August (150.66 dollars), and June (147.47 dollars) have the highest average listing prices (in dollars).

2. The number of Bedrooms, Beds, and Bathrooms are highly correlated with the price of the listing. Followed by whether or not the listing is family or kid friendly, and whether it has a TV or not. The quantitive aspects of reviews (like the total number, the ratings etc.) donâ€™t have a high positive correlation to the pricing.

3. Listings where the property is a boat have the highest average price of about 282 dollars. Followed by Condominium (151 dollars) and Loft (136 dollars).
